The [snowplow-mobile dbt package](https://hub.getdbt.com/snowplow/snowplow_mobile/latest/) transforms and aggregates the raw mobile event data collected from the Snowplow mobile trackers (e.g. the [Android tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-android-tracker), [iOS tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-objc-tracker), [React Native tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-react-native-tracker)) into a set of derived tables: *screen views, sessions, users* and *user mappings*. Modeling the data makes it easier to digest and derive business value from the Snowplow data either through AI or BI.

In this chapter you will learn how to set-up an run the snowplow-mobile package to model the sample data.
